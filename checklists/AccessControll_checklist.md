# Access Control Security Checklist

## 1️⃣ **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Are function calls properly restricted to specific roles or addresses?
- [ ] Does the contract implement `onlyOwner` or `Ownable` where required?
- [ ] Are privileged functions protected against unauthorized access?
- [ ] Have multiple roles been defined (`admin`, `user`, etc.), if needed?

## 2️⃣ **Ownership & Role Management**
- [ ] Is ownership correctly assigned in the constructor?
- [ ] Can the owner renounce ownership (`renounceOwnership()`) securely?
- [ ] Are there safeguards against accidental ownership loss?
- [ ] Can the owner transfer ownership securely (`transferOwnership()`)?

## 3️⃣ **Permission Enforcement**
- [ ] Are `msg.sender` checks correctly implemented in functions?
- [ ] Are only specific addresses allowed to modify critical data?
- [ ] Is the contract using OpenZeppelin’s `AccessControl` or `Ownable`?

## 4️⃣ **External Call Risks**
- [ ] Are there external calls that could allow privilege escalation?
- [ ] Do any external calls execute arbitrary delegate calls (`delegatecall`)?
- [ ] Are there any backdoor mechanisms that grant unintended access?

## 5️⃣ **Upgradability & Proxy Risks**
- [ ] Are upgradeable contracts (`UUPS`, `TransparentProxy`) properly restricted?
- [ ] Can an unauthorized user upgrade the contract?
- [ ] Is the `initialize()` function protected to prevent reinitialization?

## 6️⃣ **Testing & Security Reviews**
- [ ] Have unit tests been written to validate access control logic?
- [ ] Have security tools like Slither or Mythril been used to analyze access control flaws?
- [ ] Has a manual security review been conducted for all privileged functions?

✅ **If all items in this checklist are checked, the contract has strong access control mechanisms.**
