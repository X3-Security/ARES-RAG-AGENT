# Solidity Business Logic Error Checklist

This checklist is designed to help you verify that your contract’s business logic is implemented correctly. It focuses on ensuring that variables, function calls, and overall logic accurately represent the intended protocol behavior, beyond common security vulnerabilities like reentrancy or overflow/underflow.

## 1. Requirements and Domain Understanding
- [ ] **Clear Business Requirements:** Ensure that the intended behavior is well documented and understood by all team members.
- [ ] **Domain Modeling:** Verify that the contract’s variables and functions accurately represent the real-world protocol and its rules.

## 2. Variable Usage and Assignment
- [ ] **Descriptive Naming:** Use clear, descriptive variable names to avoid confusion between similar entities.
- [ ] **Correct Variable Mapping:** Double-check that each variable represents the intended data point and is used consistently throughout the logic.
- [ ] **Proper Initialization and Assignment:** Ensure variables are initialized and updated in the correct sequence to reflect the proper state transitions.

## 3. Function Implementation and Call Order
- [ ] **Accurate Function Calls:** Confirm that each function calls the correct subroutines and operates on the intended variables.
- [ ] **Correct Sequencing:** Verify that state changes and function calls occur in the proper order as per the business logic.
- [ ] **Edge Case Considerations:** Ensure that functions handle unexpected or extreme inputs in a way that still upholds business rules.

## 4. Logical Flow and Control Structures
- [ ] **Conditional Logic:** Review `if/else` and similar constructs to ensure that decision-making reflects the intended protocol.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Path Coverage:** Confirm that all possible execution paths (including default or error cases) are handled appropriately.
- [ ] **State Invariants:** Regularly check that key invariants hold true before and after business operations.

## 5. Testing and Verification
- [ ] **Unit Testing:** Write tests for each function to verify that every part of the business logic behaves as expected.
- [ ] **Integration Testing:** Simulate realistic interactions between functions and contracts to ensure overall protocol integrity.
- [ ] **Adversarial Testing:** Develop tests that simulate misuse or intentional attempts to exploit logical oversights.
- [ ] **Peer Reviews:** Conduct targeted code reviews focusing on the correctness and intent of the business logic.

## 6. Documentation and Change Management
- [ ] **In-Code Comments:** Provide clear comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of critical sections of the code.
- [ ] **External Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation detailing the protocol’s logic and assumptions.
- [ ] **Version Control Audits:** Use version control to track changes, and perform impact analysis on modifications to the business logic.

## 7. Formal Verification and External Audits
- [ ] **Formal Verification:** When possible, use formal methods to mathematically verify that the business logic meets the specified requirements.
- [ ] **Third-Party Audits:** Engage external experts to review the contract’s business logic and ensure it cannot be subverted by misusing functions or variables.
